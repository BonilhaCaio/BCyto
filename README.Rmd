**BCyto** is is an open-source project that provides an user-friendly, high-performance interface for Flow Cytometry analysis.

## Installation

**BCyto** can be installed by first installing R and typing the following commands in R console:

``` r
#to allow installation of GitHub packages
install.packages("devtools")
#to enable donwload of BioConductor dependencies
install.packages("BiocManager")
#BCyto can then be installed
devtools::install_github("BonilhaCaio/BCyto")
```

*Note: as Bioconductor currently does not support the Apple M1 (a.k.a. arm64) architecture in native mode, BCyto requires the Intel 64-bit R version (x86_64 arch) to work in Apple M1 computers. As such, when downloading R from CRAN, please choose R-x.x.x.pkg, and not R-x.x.x-arm64.pkg.*

## Usage

**BCyto** Shiny-based user interface with all its tools is generated through the package's single function:

``` r
BCyto::runBCyto()
```

## Credits and citation

A publication where dependencies and imports will be appropriately credited is on the way. Meanwhile, please cite **BCyto** as follows:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
citation("BCyto")
```
