**BCyto** is an open-source project that provides an user-friendly,
high-performance interface for Flow Cytometry analysis in R.

## Installation

**BCyto** can be installed by first installing R and typing the
following commands in the R console:

``` r
#allowing installation of GitHub packages
install.packages("devtools")
#enabling donwload of BioConductor dependencies
install.packages("BiocManager")
#installing BCyto
devtools::install_github("BonilhaCaio/BCyto")
```

*Note: as Bioconductor currently does not support the Apple M1 (a.k.a.
arm64) architecture in native mode, BCyto requires the Intel 64-bit R
version (x86_64 arch) to work in Apple M1 computers. When downloading R
from CRAN, please choose R-x.x.x.pkg, and not R-x.x.x-arm64.pkg.*

## Usage

**BCyto** Shiny-based user interface with all its tools is generated
through the packageâ€™s single function:

``` r
BCyto::runBCyto()
```
